# railyard

Railyard is a Rails application template used to scaffold rails 6 projects. Heavily influenced by mattbrictson/rails-template

## Requirements

This template currently works with:

- Rails 6.0.x
- Bundler 2.x
- PostgreSQL
- chromedriver

## Installation

_Optional._

To make this the default Rails application template on your system, create a `~/.railsrc` file with these contents:

```
-d postgresql
-m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teamairship/railyard/main/template.rb
```

## Usage

To generate a Rails application using this template, pass the `-m` option to `rails new`, like this:

```
rails new blog \
  -d postgresql \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teamairship/railyard/main/template.rb
```

_Remember that options must go after the name of the application._ The only database supported by this template is `postgresql`.

If you’ve installed this template as your default (using `~/.railsrc` as described above), then all you have to do is run:

```
rails new blog
```

## What does it do?

The template will perform the following steps:

1. Generate your application files and directories
2. Create the development and test databases
3. Sets up active storage
4. Sets up ci/cd
5. TODO: Commit everything to git

## What is included?

#### These gems are added to the standard Rails stack

- Core
  - Pundit
  - TODO: sidekiq
- Configuration
  - [dotenv][] – for local configuration
- Utilities
  - TODO: [annotate][] – auto-generates schema documentation
  - [guard][] – runs tests as you develop; mandatory for effective TDD
  - [rubocop][] – enforces Ruby code style
  - [simplecov][] – code coverage tool
- Security
  - [brakeman][] and [bundler-audit][] – detect security vulnerabilities
- Testing

## How does it work?

This project works by hooking into the standard Rails [application templates][] system, with some caveats. The entry point is the [template.rb][] file in the root of this repository.

Rails generators are very lightly documented; what you’ll find is that most of the heavy lifting is done by [Thor][]. The most common methods used by this template are Thor’s `copy_file`, `template`, and `gsub_file`. You can dig into the well-organized and well-documented [Thor source code][thor] to learn more.
